## Approach

BMI is a number calculated from an individualâ€™s weight and height. To find out BMI we will take input from the user(both height and weight) using slider and buttons. Input will be stored in height and weight variables for further calculation. The calculation process is simple, we will simply divide weight in kilograms by the square of the height. Now as per the BMI calculated, it will execute the respective if-else statement and it will show us the result on the another screen and will also gives us suggestion base of our BMI value.
